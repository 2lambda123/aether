Aether

__NOTE: Aether is currently pre-release. It almost certainly has horrible and foolish bugs that I haven't found/understood yet. If you wish to try it, feel free to do so, but be aware of that! Pull requests to fix my shortage of talent welcome.__

Aether is a lens library for F# roughly based on the Haskell Data.Lens package. It draws a distinction between Total and Partial lenses, providing separate operators and functions for composing and working with lenses that are either total or partial, along with a few common lenses for F# types.
